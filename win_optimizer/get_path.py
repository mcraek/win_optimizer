	File name: get_path.py
	Author: KM
	Date created: 2019 - 09 - 21
	Python Version: 3.7

    Description:    Used for returning the proper file path to a resource such as an image, dll, data file, etc. for a script to reference
                    when a program is compiled to a single exe using PyInstaller. This allows a program to obtainthe proper filepath
                    to a resource regardless if it's run in Production as a its single exe form, or if it's run in development /
                    called as a script instead.
                    
    To use:         Pass the filepath of an item to this function. The filepath should be relative to the project's root directory.

    Example:        There is an image within project_name/project_name/images your GUI uses. Within the GUI build script add the following:
		     
                        from get_path import get_path
		                image = get_path(project_name/images/image.PNG)
		    
                    Note: Above we reference the path to the image relative to the projectâ€™s root directory. Not sure why this is a requirement, but it is
